    "what_are_options_p1": "You can think of an <GlossaryTooltip term=\"ÊúüÊùÉ (Option)\">option</GlossaryTooltip> as a 'coupon' or 'pre-sale voucher'. This voucher gives you the 'right' to buy or sell something (like a stock) at an agreed-upon price (<GlossaryTooltip term=\"ÊâßË°å‰ª∑ (Strike Price)\">strike price</GlossaryTooltip>) at a specific time in the future (<GlossaryTooltip term=\"Âà∞ÊúüÊó• (Expiration Date)\">expiration date</GlossaryTooltip>).",
    "what_are_options_p2": "The key is that this is just a 'right', not an 'obligation'. It's like having a burger coupon: if the current price at the burger joint is much higher than your coupon price, you'll gladly use it. But if the current price is cheaper, you can choose not to use it. The coupon expires worthless, and all you've lost is the money you paid for the coupon.",
